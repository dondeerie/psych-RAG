# Psychology Course Dataset

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTICE
This is a **fictitious dataset** generated for demonstration purposes only. The data was artificially created to showcase RAG system capabilities and does not represent real students or actual course outcomes. Any patterns or insights derived from this data should be considered examples only and not used for real-world educational decision-making.

## Dataset Overview
This directory contains synthetic student performance and feedback data for a hypothetical Psychology 101 course. The data is split into two CSV files and includes a data dictionary.

## Purpose of This Dataset
- Demonstrate RAG system functionality
- Showcase data analysis capabilities
- Provide a safe testing environment for development
- Illustrate potential use cases without using sensitive student data

## Files Description

### 1. psych101-quantitative.csv
Contains generated numerical and demographic data:
- student_id: Synthetic identifier
- gender: Student gender (Female/Male/Non-binary)
- first_gen_student: First generation status (Yes/No)
- international_student: International student status (Yes/No)
- midterm_grade: Simulated score out of 100
- final_exam: Simulated score out of 100
- study_hours_per_week: Generated study hours
- attendance_rate: Simulated attendance percentage

### 2. psych101-qualitative.csv
Contains artificially generated text-based feedback:
- student_id: Synthetic identifier (links to quantitative data)
- course_review: Generated course feedback
- learning_outcomes_assessment: Generated learning assessments

### 3. psych101-data-dictionary.md
Documentation of the synthetic data structure:
- Variable definitions
- Data types
- Value ranges
- Generated data methodology

## Data Usage
This synthetic dataset is used by the RAG system to:
1. Demonstrate analysis capabilities
2. Show potential patterns and correlations
3. Test system functionality
4. Illustrate comparative analysis features

## Notice on Data Representation
While efforts have been made to create realistic-looking data, all patterns, correlations, and insights are artificial and should not be used to make real-world educational decisions or generalizations about student performance.

## Usage Examples
See the notebooks directory for example analyses and usage patterns with this synthetic data.
